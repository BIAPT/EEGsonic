Steps to run examples:

Note 1: Please see the Amp Server Pro SDK 2.1 Users Guide and Amp Server Pro SDK 2.1
        Network Protocols, Data Formats, and Technical Details for the overall architecture
        of Amp Server and Amp Server.

Note 2: The below steps are if you would like to compile the examples. If you merely wish to run
        run them without modification, you can find the precompiled binaries in the ./examples/bin
        directory.

######

Note: For all Xcode-based applications, please open the project file (for example, in
      the Amp Server Pro SDK Write to MFF Application, AmpServerProSDKWriteToMFF.xcodeproj,
      and build either from the menu, or by typing: (cmd-'b').

--- Simple Client ---

1) type: make
2) type: ./simpleClient

The simpleClient application has various command line options. To see what these are, execute:
3) ./simpleClient -h 

Note: The scripting for this example is primative and easily defeated. Modify as you desire.

######

--- Amp Server Pro SDK Write to MFF Application ---

1) Build.
2) Usage of this application is mostly self-evident. For any questions, please contact EGI Support.

######

--- Low-level API example ---

Note: The Low level api verison is standalone.

1) type: g++ low_level_api.cpp

######

--- Amp Lab ---

Please read the readme.txt file in the Amp Lab directory. It contains detailed instructs on
how to use this example.

######

--- ECI ---

The ECI example is a simple example of a client / server application using the ECI protocol. To use
this example, you need to:

1) Build.
2) Run the ECIServer and ECIClient applications.
3) Start the ECI Server. You may specify a different port than the default if you desire.
4) Connect the ECI Client to the ECI Server (using the same port).
5) Send some test commands.

Please note, this is ONLY a very basic example. It does not "do" anything, other than provide an
example of how to use the ECI networking protocols. Full encoding and decoding of events is provided
within the Amp Server Pro SDK libraries from an MFFEvent object.

For any questions, please contact EGI support.

######

All the above assumes:
1) You have an amplifier connected with the correct IP address.
2) The Amp Server (in the case of an NA 300) is from the SAME Amp Server Pro SDK release package.
