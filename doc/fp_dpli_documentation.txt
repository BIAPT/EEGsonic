Same instructions as 4, but using dPLI instead of PLI.  Same output to OSC every 10 seconds.  
Hub locations
This feature will only be possible to calculate with the EGI amplifier (e.g. 128 channels).  
Again, we will need to see if this is feasible in real-time.  For a window of 10 seconds of EEG data:
Calculate the wPLI values of all combinations of electrodes, corrected with 10 iterations of surrogate wPLI.  
Choose the top 10% of wPLI values (this value will also need to be adjustable).
Calculate the degree of each electrode.
Find the electrode with the highest degree. 
Every 30 seconds, output the average location (check with Florian how he wants this ? MNI coordinates?) of the highest degree node to OSC.
