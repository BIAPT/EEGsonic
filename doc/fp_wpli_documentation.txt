We are interested in how the midline frontoparietal wPLI and lateral frontoparietal wPLI change with consciousness (midline functional connectivity is more connected to internal/self awareness, while lateral functional connectivity is more connected to awareness of the external environment).  
Using a 10-second window of EEG from these electrodes:
	Midline:
For the EGI system, use the EEG data from 6 electrodes around Fz (electrodes 4, 10, 11, 16, 18, 19) and 5 electrodes around Pz (electrodes 61, 62, 67, 72, 77, 78).  
For the DSI-24 system, use the EEG data from 3 frontal electrodes (F3, Fz, F4) and 3 parietal electrodes (P3, Pz, P4).  
Lateral:
For the EGI system use EEG data from electrodes: lateral frontal (27, 33, 34, 116, 122, 123) and lateral parietal (51, 58, 59, 96, 97, 101)
For the DSI-24 system, use the EEG data from lateral frontal (F7, F8) and lateral parietal (P7, P8).
For each window, calculate the wPLI for all combinations of frontal to parietal electrodes for the midline, and all frontal to parietal electrodes for lateral.  
We will need to test the next part to see if it is feasible in real-time, but ideally: shuffle the data ~10 times to develop an approximate surrogate wPLI.  Find the average surrogate wPLI, subtract it from the calculated wPLI.  
Average surrogate-corrected frontoparietal PLI values for all midline electrodes, and lateral electrodes.  Output these two values to OSC every 10 seconds.
